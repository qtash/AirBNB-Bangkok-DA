# Popularly-booked AirBNB Bangkok Listings Data Analysis
A Data Analysis Study Case Project focused on the accommodations popularity based on its 1-year future availability and past reviews metrics. 

## Background
AirBNB is an online marketplace broker for short and long-term homestays and experiences in various countries and regions, including Bangkok, Thailand's magnificent capital city, which always buzzing with tourists around the world. 

## Problem Questions
AirBNB Bangkok Headquarters wants to know **accommodations with the most demand** (1 year) to adjust its marketing strategy and help increase annual revenue. 

**What's the most popular accommodation amongst AirBNB Bangkok listings (the most fully booked throughout the next year)?**

Other than the scarcity of the listings `availability` (booked days), the popularity of a listing property could also be defined by the `reviews`. Generally, popular items tend to have more and newer reviews. Hence we will see if the availability of the accommodations correlates with their reviews and see if **the listings booking demand associated with those review parameters**.
